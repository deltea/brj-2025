This project uses the Singleton programming design pattern, which means all important managers are globally accessible to from every single file in the project, and can also store state. For example, audio managers, scene managers, and everything that needs to be global. Every singleton is named in PascalCase. Be careful not to use to many singletons, since it can clutter up the project. Singletons are made by registering the file in the "Autoload" section in project settings.
